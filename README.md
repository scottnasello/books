# Books I'm interested in

This repository defines books Scott Nasello is interested in.

I was inspired by Navy Seal Captain Bob Schoultz.  Whenever he reads a book he will writes a summary of his take aways.
His book site, [Bob's Corner](https://bobscorner.wordpress.com/bobs-books/) is located here and I plan to make this my practice in 2017.

I'll just list my 2016 books for now (until I can add my summary)
